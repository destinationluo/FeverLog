    <h3>Fever & Symptom Tracker Log Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 7, 2025</p>

    <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
    <p>Welcome to Fever & Symptom Tracker Log. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our application.</p>
    <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. Our core principle is simple: <strong>We do not collect, store, or share any of your personal or health data.</strong></p>

    <h4>2. What Information We Collect</h4>
    <p>Fever & Symptom Tracker Log does not collect any personally identifiable information. All data you enter into the app, including your child's name, age, temperature readings, symptoms, and medication records, is stored <strong>exclusively on your own device</strong>. As the developers, we do not have access to, nor can we view or extract, this information.</p>

    <h4>3. How We Use Your Information</h4>
    <p>Since we do not collect any of your personal information, we do not use your information for any purpose.</p>

    <h4>4. Data Sharing & Disclosure</h4>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or disclose your data to any third parties because we never have access to it in the first place. This app is designed to be a completely private, offline-first tool for your peace of mind.</p>
    <p><em>(Note: This MVP version does not use any third-party services like analytics or crash reporting tools that would collect user data.)</em></p>

    <h4>5. Children's Privacy</h4>
    <p>This application is intended for use by <strong>parents and guardians</strong> to record health information for the children under their care. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. All data related to children is entered by their guardian and stored on the guardian's own device.</p>

    <h4>6. Data Security</h4>
    <p>The security of your data is ensured by the built-in security features of your own device (such as your Passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID). Because all data is stored locally on your device, we recommend that you secure your device with a strong passcode or biometric authentication.</p>

    <h4>7. Changes to This Policy</h4>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
